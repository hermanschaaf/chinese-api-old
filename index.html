# Chinese API
## A powerful API for Chinese example sentences, word definitions and reading difficulty levels.

### How it works
Chinese API is a RESTful API for easy access to ChineseLevel resources. Free for up to 5,000 requests a month, open-source, and useful in numerous situations. It is best illustrated by an example:

```
http://api.chineselevel.com/sentences?w=我们&limit=2
```

```
{
    "meta": {
        "limit": 20,
        "next": "/sentences/?username=chineselevel11&limit=20&w=%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC&offset=20",
        "offset": 0,
        "previous": null,
        "total_count": 259
    },
    "objects": [
        {
            "chinese": "我们的任务到目前为止很轻松，但从现在开始将会变得很难。",
            "english": "Our task has been easy so far, but it will be difficult from now on.",
            "simplified": true
        },
        {
            "chinese": "如果我们知道我们在做什么，那么这不能称之为研究，是吗？",
            "english": "If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it?",
            "simplified": true
        }
    ]
}
